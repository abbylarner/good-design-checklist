#Good Design Checklist
## _A list of things you can (and should) do to make your designs better_

###Typography

####CSS
- [ ] Minimum line-height of 1.4 - 1.6
- [ ] Minimum font size of 16px for paragraph text
- [ ] Max width of 600px or 40em on all text blocks
- [ ] NO CENTER ALIGNING TEXT!

####Fonts
- [ ] Choose simple, sans serif fonts
- [ ] No more than 2 fonts (I would suggest 1 font in several different weights)
- [ ] Avoid "common fonts" (examples: Papyrus, Comic Sans, Impact, Brush Script)

###Hierarchy
- [ ] Spacing between related elements is closer than spacing between different elements
- [ ] Most important content should take up the majority of the page 
- [ ] There should be a distinct difference between headers, sub-headers, and paragraph text (font-size, bold, italics are good ways of doing this)

###Code
- [ ] Include meta tag for responsive design
    + `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
`
- [ ] Add a reset style sheet [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

###Other
- [ ] If you are using a carousel for your homepage, there should be no more than 1 image per 10 seconds
- [ ] Make sure images are responsive while maintaining the original aspect ratio of the image
